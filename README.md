# GoPractice
The first go practice:
- Build a program computing the summary, substraction, multiplication, and division of two large real numbers.
- The program doesn't use any built-in functions for large numbers or converting string to number.

# Requirements
+ Go 1.16.1

# Installation
Only the need of cloning from Github
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/lngochuy/GoPractice1
$ cd GoPractice1
GoPractice1$ _
```

# Run
For testing the package
```shell
GoPractice1$ go test ./...
```

For a demo
```shell
GoPractice1$ go run main.go
```

If you don't have any suitable Go compilers, you could run directly the excutable file
```shell
GoPractice1$ .\gopractice.exe
```

Example:
```shell
GoPractice1$ go run main.go
Input the first number: 13.5
Input the second number: 22.7
Choose the operator (+-*/): /
Result: 13.5 / 22.7 = .5947136563
```
